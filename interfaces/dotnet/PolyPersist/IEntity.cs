	/// IEntity interface represents a generic entity with an ID and etag.
	/// The 'etag' is used for versioning or concurrency control in databases, often representing the entity's current version.
	/// The 'id' is the unique identifier for the entity within the collection or data store.
	/// These properties ensure that each entity has a unique identifier and version for data integrity.

		/// The 'id' property represents the unique identifier for the entity.
		/// This ID is typically used to reference and retrieve the entity from the data store.
		public string id { get; set;}
		/// The 'etag' property represents the entity's version tag or a unique identifier used for concurrency control.
		/// It is typically used to detect changes or updates in the entity, ensuring that the correct version of the entity is being modified.
		public string etag { get; set;}
		/// The 'PartitionKey' property represents the key used to partition data in distributed data stores.
		/// This allows for more efficient storage and retrieval of entities, especially in large-scale, partitioned systems.
		///
		/// Why PartitionKey is Important:
		/// - It ensures that related data is grouped together in the same partition, reducing cross-partition queries.
		/// - It improves the performance of read and write operations by minimizing data distribution overhead.
		/// - It is crucial for ensuring scalability in cloud-based systems like Azure Cosmos DB or Amazon DynamoDB.
		///
		/// Example Use Case:
		/// In a multi-tenant application, the 'PartitionKey' could be the tenant ID, ensuring that all data
		/// for a particular tenant is stored and queried efficiently.
		///
		/// This property is marked as 'readonly' to ensure that the partition key remains immutable,
		/// as changing it would lead to significant system inconsistencies.
		public string PartitionKey { get; }
