		/// The 'PartitionKey' property represents the key used to partition data in distributed data stores.
		/// This allows for more efficient storage and retrieval of files, especially in large-scale, partitioned systems.
		///
		/// Why PartitionKey is Important:
		/// - It ensures that related data is grouped together in the same partition, reducing cross-partition queries.
		/// - It improves the performance of read and write operations by minimizing data distribution overhead.
		/// - It is crucial for ensuring scalability in cloud-based systems like Azure Cosmos DB or Amazon DynamoDB.
		///
		/// Example Use Case:
		/// In a multi-tenant application, the 'PartitionKey' could be the tenant ID, ensuring that all data
		/// for a particular tenant is stored and queried efficiently.
		///
		/// This property is marked as 'readonly' to ensure that the partition key remains immutable,
		/// as changing it would lead to significant system inconsistencies.
